btrfs-dump
==========

`btrfs-dump` is a metadata dumper for btrfs, which produces compact text output.
The chief advantage over `btrfs inspect-internal dump-tree` is that is easily
diff-able, so you can do for instance:

```shell
# ./btrfs-dump -t 5 test > before.txt
# mount -o noatime test /root/temp
# touch /root/temp/file
# umount /root/temp
# ./btrfs-dump -t 5 test > after.txt
# diff -u before.txt after.txt
```

and get:

So you can see that the following happened by touch-ing a file...
* The atime, ctime, and mtime of the inode_item for inode 101 were updated
* The sequence value of the inode_item was increased by one
* The transid value of the inode_item was increased
* The virtual address ("bytenr" in "header") of the tree block changed (i.e. because it was COWed)
* The disk location ("physical") of the block changed (from 2500000 and 5830000 in test to 2504000 and 5834000 - two copies because we have DUP metadata)
* And finally that the csum value of the header changed, because the contents of the block changed

Note that unlike `btrfs-progs` and `dmesg` virtually all the nubers are in hex,
because it's easier to work with. The exceptions are the dates and times
(obviously) and the "mode" of inode_item, which is in its traditional octal
form.

The supported output should be completely comprehensive: if you find something
valid that `btrfs-dump` fails to understand, please open an issue.

Usage
-----

`btrfs-dump [option] <device> [<device>...]`

Options:

* `-t|--tree <tree_id>`: only output the specified tree. Values can be decimal,
hexadecimal (with a leading "0x"), or the same strings that `btrfs-progs`
supports (e.g. `-t fs` as a synonym for `-t 5`)

If you only give one device for a multi-device filesystem, it will use
`libblkid` to try and find the other devices - or you can always specify them
manually.

Compilation
-----------

This uses C++ modules, so you will need a recent version of CMake and GCC. You
will also need `libblkid`.

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -GNinja ..
$ ninja
```
